            Thus the young priest set out on an incredible adventure that, over
            the arch of many decades, led him to initiate innumerable projects.
            He started in 1914 with a small group of boys and the command to
            publish Alba's diocesan newspaper, and by the end of his life he had
            founded five religious congregations, four secular institutes,
            numerous Catholic publishing houses throughout the world, magazines,
            a network of media centres that he hoped would serve as sources of
            light for all who visited them. His original interest in the medium
            of the press expanded as he realised that the Church of today must
            be present in the cinema, in television, in the world of music and
            in every field of human communication furnished by progress. He did
            not live to see the development of the Internet, but all the
            languages and instruments of modern communication attracted his
            interest because he saw them as ways of responding to the social and
            pastoral problems of his time. Participating in Vatican Council II,
            he had the satisfaction of seeing the Council documents acknowledge
            many of the intuitions he had laboured long and hard to concretise.
