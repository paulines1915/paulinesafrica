            Like Paul, who declared: "The love of Christ urges us on" (2Cor
            5:14), at the dawn of the 20th century Blessed Alberione felt
            interiorly moved by an appeal of love from Jesus in the Eucharist,
            who yearns to draw all people to himself and who prompted him to
            begin a new apostolate and a new religious family. Thus the young
            priest set out on an incredible adventure that, over the arch of
            many decades, led him to initiate innumerable projects. He started
            in 1914 with a small group of boys and the command to publish Alba's
            diocesan newspaper, and by the end of his life he had founded five
            religious congregations, four secular institutes, numerous Catholic
            publishing houses throughout the world, magazines, a network of
            media centres that he hoped would serve as sources of light for all
            who visited them. His original interest in the medium of the press
            expanded as he realised that the Church of today must be present in
            the cinema, in television, in the world of music and in every field
            of human communication furnished by progress. He did not live to see
            the development of the Internet, but all the languages and
            instruments of modern communication attracted his interest because
            he saw them as ways of responding to the social and pastoral
            problems of his time. Participating in Vatican Council II, he had
            the satisfaction of seeing the Council documents acknowledge many of
            the intuitions he had laboured long and hard to concretise.
